        Hello! My name is Angelo Syrean Blanchard Bonifacio, and I'm passionate about
        becoming a skilled front-end developer. I believe that growth comes
        through continuous learning and experimentation, which is why I've
        created this website as my personal playground for coding. Here, you'll
        find my journey as I dive into various front-end technologies, testing
        ideas, exploring new techniques, and learning from both successes and
        mistakes. This platform is a reflection of my commitment to improving my
        skills and staying at the forefront of web development. Thank you for
        joining me on this exciting adventure!
                </p>

            <div class="desc">
                <p>
        I am currently a 3rd-year student at Gordon College - College of
        Computer Studies, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information
        Technology. At 20 years old, I'm at an exciting point in my academic
        journey, eager to learn and grow in the field of IT. While I may not be
        the most expressive person, I find strength in being a good listener,
        which allows me to understand and connect with others on a deeper level.
        Although I may not excel at everything, I am determined to be versatile
        and proficient in as many areas as possible. I believe in continuous
        improvement and am always looking for opportunities to expand my
        knowledge and skills. There's so much I want to share with the world,
        and I'm looking forward to the experiences and challenges that lie
        ahead.
